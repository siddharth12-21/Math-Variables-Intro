    //We will be using System.out.println and System.out.print throughout the year. Try using both below to see what the difference is!
    //ANSWER: println automatically goes to the next line while print continues on the same line

    //Throughout the year this year we will need to store information. For that we will be using VARIABLES!
    //Java is an Object-Oriented programming language. All variables we use this year will either be OBJECTS or PRIMITIVES
    //There are 8 primitives in Java: int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, char
    //For AP we need to know: int, double, boolean
    //List examples of the types below and give definition
    //int (integer): 
    //double:
    //boolean:
    //For now we are just going to work with primitive
    //Create 3 variables of each of the above types (USE GOOD CODING PRACTICE WHEN CREATING THE VARIABLES

    int count = 21;
    int c = 0;
    double ba = 1.7;
    boolean isTrue = true;

    //MATH TIME!

    //What are the math operators that we can use?
    //+ - * / %

    //Try doing some math operations with numbers. How can we check to see if the math worked?

    //Create codes that will print the following:

    //Odd integers from 1 to 100, inclusive of both



    //All multiples of 3 from 1 to 100




    //Starting at 1000, print on the same line (with a - [hypthen] between each) all of the numbers that end in 0 going down to 0
